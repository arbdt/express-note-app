# 11: Express Note Web App

## About
This repo is for BCS assignment 11: Express Note Taker. This is a web application that runs using JavaScript via Express.
The app allows users to read, save, and delete notes to a file on the server.

The HTML pages, CSS style sheet, front-end JavaScript file, and storage file were provided to me as-is. My task for this project was to fill out a server.js file with Express content to make the application work.

## Preview
This project is also available on Heroku.
